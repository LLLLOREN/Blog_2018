                    <h3>A bowl of glutinous rice in the autumn</h3>
                    <p>Glutinous rice, the north is called Jiangmi, and my family likes to call it rice. When I was young, although I didn't know why there was a "wine" in the name of this rice, I always liked it. When it was a magical ingredient, it could be made into rice, rice, scorpion, etc. Wait. Every time I let steamed rice, she always complains about trouble, and asks me "Is it particularly delicious, I can't help it." She couldn't help but smile when she saw me look forward to it. When I was a little older, I was introduced to a new drink, rice wine. Now recalling, I called the glutinous rice for so long, "the wine rice", all for the morning dawn of the dawn - the rice is the rice of rice wine.<br><br>
                        When I was still living in Sichuan, I wanted to eat rice wine and went to the street to fight. The local name was “醪粉粉子”. In the morning, the guy in the shop used Sichuan dialect to drink everyone. After leaving Sichuan, every time I want to drink rice wine, I have to go to the restaurant of Shanghai cuisine and order some small balls of wine. Nowadays, there are fewer and fewer opportunities to eat, and even if you drink it occasionally, it is not a taste in memory.<br><br>
                        This year, I went back to my grandfather's house in the Spring Festival. They have already moved to Tianjin (there are many accidents at home, and they are not listed). In those two weeks, I went to sleep late every night, and I used to eat a variety of dishes that I liked to eat. Of course, I also included rice and rice dumplings. I was full on the sofa. I finished the meal after dinner in the evening. My grandfather and I have already started watching TV, but I haven’t come over for a long time. I went to the kitchen to find her and found that she was on fire again, steaming things. I asked her what she was going to do. She said that she would give me a rice wine. I must have been eating it for a long time. It must be very embarrassing. When I was a child, I never saw her doing rice wine, thinking that I could only go to the street to buy, so I was surprised to ask her how to do it at home, why have never seen you do it. He said, because doing this can be too much trouble, the pots and pans must be washed and burned once to ensure sterility; the hands should be clean; the rice should be steamed in advance, and the fermentation temperature and time should be controlled. That night, I watched her steamed, smashed it, mixed it with yeast, and then loaded it into a small jar. Finally, she told me to dig a small pit in the middle of the rice. After a day or two, I saw that there was wine in the pit, which was fermented. Soon, I ate the powder that I had long missed.<br><br>
                        On the day I left home, at my request, I gave me some rice and a little yeast, and I explained it to me and gave me a clean pottery. Now, half a year has passed. The weather has turned cold from last week. I finally remembered that I still have rice and yeast, and I got up early in the morning to soak up the rice. When I got back from work, I found out the small clay pot that I gave, and put it on the side of the boiled water. Then I plugged in the electric steamer and wrapped the already expanded rice with the drawer cloth brought by the house. . While steaming, burn other containers and tools to be used, and prepare cold drinking water to do it during the process. In short, the whole process was in a mess, and many meters fell out when the cans were filled. Even so, in the end, I managed to put the clean wine into the clay pot, dig a small pit, and then seal it up.<br><br>
                        When I opened the cans on the third morning, I could already smell the faint scent: there was no other flavor, only the aroma of alcohol and rice - it seems that the sterility is doing well and there is no pollution. The moment I came out to drink, I was a little touched, and there was something else that I couldn’t tell. This is the first time I have made a "home taste." It’s not just the taste of the Spring Festival, but also the taste of the bad food that I bought from the small shop in Sichuan’s hometown. It's not the kind of meager in the big city, not a few meters of rice wine; it's simple, just brewed, accompanied by the feeling of playing rice. Of course, I didn't have so much time to express my feelings. I quickly drank a bowl, had breakfast, and went out. On the way, I sent a voice and a photo to tell her that I had succeeded in making rice wine for the first time. It was very delicious. She has been greatly praised for a long time.</p>
